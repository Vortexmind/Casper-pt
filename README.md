This is a fork of the default [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) theme, [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) 
This theme is used on [www.paolotagliaferri.com](https://www.paolotagliaferri.com). Please refer to the main Casper theme for all the main instructions.

This fork is regularly kept up to date with the main theme development, bugfixes and updates.

This theme is avialable under the same [MIT license](LICENSE) as the original [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) theme.

Happy hacking!
